\doxysubsection*{Handling an Issue}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Shift the issue to \textquotesingle{}in progress\textquotesingle{} mode and assign it to yourself. 
\item Create a feature branch following the naming guideline\+: feature/\+MAUI-\/\+APP\#$<$your issue number$>$, and push changes directly to it, NOT to Develop or Master. 
\item Ensure that all commit messages are descriptive enough for the entire team to comprehend your contributions. 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\doxysubsection*{Merging your Branch to Develop/\+Master}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Be sure to add enough comments to your code and conduct necessary tests. 
\item Once done, create a Pull Request (PR) to merge your branch into Develop, and another PR to fuse Develop to Master. To avoid merge conflicts, regularly update your branch with Develop BEFORE creating a PR. 
\item When creating a PR, get your code reviewed by your buddy (Buddy list can be found in pinned messages in the Discord) to ensure everyone is taking responsibility for some part of the project. Take into consideration any comments they make before moving forward. Moreover, click on "{}squash commit"{} when completing a PR to keep our repository uncluttered. 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\doxysubsection*{Merging Changes to The Master Branch}

If after chasing your buddy, 24 hours elapse without any response or acknowledgement of a pertinent update or alteration from your buddy, then send a request on Discord and any team member is permitted to step in and administer changes as needed to keep the development process running smoothly and efficiently. 

\doxysubsection*{Kanban Definition of Done\+:}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Take into account all the acceptance criteria mentioned in the issue. 
\item Ensure that all integration tests/\+Unit tests have been successfully run or written if necessary. 
\item Resolve and address all review comments as needed. 
\item Any additional details should be posted in the comments section of the issue page itself to provide the assigned programmer with adequate information. 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
