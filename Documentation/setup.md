## Setting up personal environment

### Visual Studio
1. Check if Visual Studio 2022 is installed with the required .NET MAUI templates (You can do this in Visual Studio by searching for the .NET MAUI App templates when creating a new project), if they're avaliable to use then you have finished all of the required setup done for Visual Studio.
2. If you do not have Visual Studio installed, look at the steps [here](https://github.com/edinburgh-napier/SET09102/blob/main/practicals/01_setup.md#recommendations) to install with the .NET MAUI templates

### Personal GitHub Portfolio
1. Follow the link [here](https://github.com/edinburgh-napier/SET09102_portfolio/tree/main) to get to the template for the personal portfolio, use the template to create a new personal repository of it.
2. Update the README so that it no longer contains the boiler plate text and is personal to you. 
3. Each week you will make updates to the specific markdown file for that week. It is reccomended that you keep the content in the file until you're just about to submit it so that you can use the lists to ensure you have done everything required.

### Team GitHub Repository
1. Go to this [GitHub](https://github.com/Software-Engineering-Red/Team_Project) repository to clone down the team repository, if you're unable to access the repository then join the Discord channel to request access or speak to another member of the team so that they can give you access to the repository and organisation.
