<h1>Workflow:</h1>
<h2>Handling an Issue</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Shift the issue to 'in progress' mode and assign it to yourself.</li>
    <li>Create a feature branch following the naming guideline: feature/MAUI-APP#<your issue number>, and push changes directly to it, NOT to Develop or Master.</li>
    <li>Ensure that all commit messages are descriptive enough for the entire team to comprehend your contributions.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Merging your Branch to Develop/Master</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Be sure to add enough comments to your code and conduct necessary tests.</li>
    <li>Once done, create a Pull Request (PR) to merge your branch into Develop, and another PR to fuse Develop to Master. To avoid merge conflicts, regularly update your branch with Develop BEFORE creating a PR.</li>
    <li>When creating a PR, get your code reviewed by at least two peers. Take into consideration any comments they make before moving forward. Moreover, click on "squash commit" when completing a PR to keep our repository uncluttered.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Kanban Definition of Done:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Take into account all the acceptance criteria mentioned in the issue.</li>
    <li>Ensure that all integration tests/Unit tests have been successfully run or written if necessary.</li>
    <li>Resolve and address all review comments as needed.</li>
    <li>Any additional details should be posted in the comments section of the issue page itself to provide the assigned programmer with adequate information.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Code Review Process</h1>
<p>
  Our code review procedure is systematic and designed to maintain the quality and uniformity of our projects. Here are the steps:
</p>

<h2>Submitting a Review</h2>
<p>
  To kick off a code review, adhere to these steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Initiate a review request on our Discord team workflow.</li>
  <li>The lead reviewer, Zsombor, will handle most GitHub administrative tasks related to the review.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Prompt Reviews</h2>
<p>
  We strive to complete reviews as promptly as possible. If your review request remains unanswered for more than 24 hours, kindly send a reminder message in our Discord channel.
</p>

<h2>Transparent Feedback</h2>
<p>
  We encourage open dialogue and constructive feedback. The review should include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Providing valuable feedback on the reviewed code by all team members.</li>
  <li>Incorporating the feedback and obtaining agreement from the lead reviewer, Zsombor.</li>
  <li>If an agreement isn't reached within 24 hours, any team member is free to contribute their input.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Resolving Issues</h2>
<p>
  Issues connected to the code review will be resolved by Justin or any team member after a span of 24 hours, assuring a streamlined and efficient workflow.
